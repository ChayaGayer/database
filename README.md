### SQL Scripts
The following scripts are provided for interacting with the database:
- ðŸ“œ [create_tables.sql](phase1/files/create_tables_user.sql) â€“ Create database tables
- ðŸ“œ [insert_tables.sql](phase1/files/insert_tables_fixed.sql) â€“ Insert sample data
- ðŸ“œ [drop_tables.sql](phase1/files/drop_tables_no_cascade.sql) â€“ Drop all tables
- ðŸ“œ [selectAll_tables.sql](phase1/files/selectAll_tables_structured.sql) â€“ Select data from all tables

### Data
using Python to generate CSV files with faker package to
automate the generation of 400 rows per table

using Mockaroo
Mockaroo was used to generate realistic CSV data files:

ðŸ“œ customers.csv â€“ 400 customers with valid names, emails, phones, and addresses

## 2. Integration Decisions

- Table `X` from the new department was merged with table `Y` in the central schema.
- Field `Z` was added to allow linking between orders and shipments.
- Redundant fields (e.g., `old_status`) were removed to prevent data duplication.
- Foreign key constraints were adjusted to support new relationships.
- Views were created to abstract and unify data for queries.
